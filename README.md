# Vibe Coding Sessions

This repository contains my Vibe Coding sessions - a collaborative coding approach where I work alongside Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI coding assistant, to create and improve software projects. The term "Vibe Coding" represents a relaxed, conversational style of programming where we bounce ideas off each other, solve problems together, and create code that's both functional and elegant.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is more than just programming - it's a collaborative experience where:
- Human creativity meets AI assistance
- Complex problems are broken down into manageable steps
- Code is written with both functionality and readability in mind
- Learning happens naturally through discussion and implementation
- Projects evolve organically through iterative improvements

## Projects

### Fusion
A strategic battle game where players compete to create powerful energy cores through fusion reactions and eliminate opponent cores.

**Key Features:**
- Canvas-based rendering with smooth animations
- Core fusion and elimination mechanics
- Mobile-friendly design
- Modular architecture

[View Project README](Fusion/README.md)

### Flight Simulator
A 3D flight simulator demonstrating advanced physics and control systems.

**Key Features:**
- 3D flight simulation with realistic physics
- Complex aircraft control systems
- Dynamic camera views
- Atmospheric conditions simulation

[View Project README](FlightSim/README.md)

### Simple Platformer
A 2D platformer game showcasing basic physics and player movement mechanics.

**Key Features:**
- Basic 2D platformer mechanics
- Player movement and jumping
- Simple collision detection
- Responsive controls

## Future Projects
This space will be updated as new projects are added to the repository. Each project will have its own dedicated directory with a detailed README explaining its purpose, features, and implementation details.

## Getting Started
To explore any of the projects:
1. Navigate to the project's directory
2. Read the project-specific README for setup instructions
3. Open the main HTML file in a modern web browser

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Canvas API
- WebGL (for Flight Simulator)
- No external dependencies required

## Contributing
This is a personal repository documenting my Vibe Coding sessions. While it's primarily for my own use, suggestions and feedback are welcome through issues or pull requests.

## Credits
All projects in this repository were developed with assistance from Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI coding assistant that helps with:
- Code architecture and organization
- Implementation of features
- Bug fixes and optimizations
- Documentation and README creation
