# Flight Simulator - Vibe Coding Demo

This directory contains a flight simulator implementation using vibe coding principles. The simulator demonstrates 3D flight dynamics and aircraft control systems.

## Contents

- `flight_sim.html`: Main simulation file containing the implementation of the flight simulator

## Features

- 3D flight simulation
- Realistic flight physics
- Aircraft control systems
- Dynamic camera views
- Atmospheric conditions simulation

## How to Run

1. Open `flight_sim.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use the following controls:
   - W/S: Pitch control (nose up/down)
   - A/D: Roll control (bank left/right)
   - Q/E: Yaw control (rudder left/right)
   - Shift/Ctrl: Throttle control

## Technical Details

The simulator is built using WebGL and JavaScript, implementing various vibe coding concepts:
